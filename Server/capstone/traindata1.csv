2,2,Janica Louis Naganga,"Person want bigbang to comeback?

??",0
3,3,Mike Way,"Why Bigbang are called The Kings of Kpop?? Here we go:

1. Bigbang is one of the first group to start writing and producing their own music. G-Dragon is the first idol to do it. And not only writing songs but he produced such a hit song(Lies-Bigbang). After that agencies started giving their idols chance to do it.

2.  Bigbang is the first one to have official lightstick.The first official lightstick in kpop was designed by G-Dragon. It was called Bang Bong. Since then all fandoms followed it and now every fandom has their own lightstick.

3. T.O.P is the first underground rapper turned idol in kpop and the first rapper in kpop to have a deep voice. After that it became a trend for every group to have a rapper with a deep voice.

4. Bigbang is the first boy group to dye their hair bright unusual colors like pink, blue, neon green, orange. G-Dragon made it trend, starting from blonde there is no color he hasn't tried. Now every kpop idol will color their hair differently in every comeback.

5. Bigbang is the first group that members have solo careers without disbanding. Before bigbang, groups always disbanded or the member just left if one of them wants to pursuit their own career. But Bigbang showed them you can have solo career while still being in the group. Taeyang and Gdragon have won daesangs(main awards) for their solo career and always topped the charts including Billboard. Daesung was so popular in Japan (more popular than bigbang itself lol)

6. And to this day G-Dragon is still the only soloist from idol groups to win Artist of the Year/Daesang.

7. In 2014, G-dragon won World's Best Entertainer Of The Year and World's Best Album at World Music Awards,
and the first kpop act to have two albums on the Billboard 200.

8. Seungri once had his own vocal and dance academy that have trained many idols such as J-Hope from BTS, Mijoo from Lovelyz, Jinwoo from Winner, Zelo from B.A.P , Hyung Won from Monsta X, Hye Lin from EXID and many other artists.

9. First kpop artist to collaborate with western artist. G-Dragon's collaboration with Flo Rida back in 2009.

10. First kpop group to win an international award. In 2011, they won MTV EMA. They beat Britney Spears that day. They also won World's Best Group, World's Best Live Act and World's Best Video Of The Year (Fantastic Baby) in 2014 World Music Awards.

11. They were able to enter U.S Billboard Charts 200 (2012) with a full korean album making them the first Kpop group to achieve that without any promotion in U.S

12. They introduced the concept of EP(Mini Album) to kpop.

13. They set the fashion trends because they were the inspiration for many fashion designers.

14. G-Dragon is the one who made kpop idol airport fashion trend. He also become the first asian
to be a global brand ambassador of fashion brand (Chanel)

15. They are also called the kings of live performances coz their stage presences were insane. When you impressed by watching their MVs, trust me their live performances are better !!! 

16. And until now Bigbang still trending everyday in Melon (Biggest music streaming platform in korea) without doing anything and not releasing any music. Their last song before hiatus titled ""Flower Road"" broke many records and topped all the charts in korea without a single promotion and they were already in the military when the song was released.

17. Today they are still the best selling kpop group in China's history despite being 4 years of hiatus. 

18. They are your idols' idols, many idols wanted to be idols because of them. Big Bang may not be your bias, but they're your bias' bias

19. They have conquered two generations since their debut in 2006(2nd gen) and when they comeback in this 4th gen, imagine the impact.

Their influence and impact in kpop is heavy.They are the blueprints of kpop that is why they are called the KINGS.",0

1. Not easy for a group band to perform slow music (loser) with a strong stage presence. and the 5 of them shine.
2. They just dance randomly instead like those idol need to used choreograph to make the performance professional. BIGBANG can make their performance still shine with just random dance. Their stage presence undeniable is one of the best.",0

The genre is K-trot and it has its own unique beats and melodies. Before you make rude comments, go and study it. And the Korean music fans tend to equate the fandom’s behavior with the singers’. They notice whose fans are leaving what kind messages and tend to judge their singers accordingly. That is why most Korean K-pop fans are very careful when they leave comments for other groups if they do at all.",0

People around have left
I get nervous differently from day to day
Falling to the floor, you can't love me yeah,
I can't hide
All the burdens squeeze your throat yeah yeah yeah
I can hear the sound of cursing me in my head
Since then, my heart is beating irregularly
The world is moving busy. I'm alone and stop
Looking at the ceiling
The devil beckoned and smiled again
I didn't want to gesture too, that was all
Then one day dawn
Then one day at dawn, my heart stopped
The kaleidoscope is grazed
A red traffic light is on for me
Even though Bongyeom performed CPR and became alive, my soul still stopped at the edge of the cliff.
Time stops, why only me stops, the red water right in front of my eyes
Sweaty body, the atmosphere is still, what do I say
Mom, I'll make money, fosho, I don't hurt at all right now
I feel like loco, except for me, everyone goes first, but I stop alone again
The sweaty atmosphere is honest, what the hell am I going to do?
Mom, I'll make money, fosho, I don't hurt at all right now
I feel like loco, except for me, everyone goes first, but I stop alone again
It's the green light time to be shine, let's laugh now because it was hard because of our money
It's the red light time to get down, let's just hide because it's still hard for our money
People around me have left, I get anxious differently from day to day yeah
Falling to the floor, you can't love me yeah
I can't hide
All the burdens squeeze your throat yeah yeah yeah
I can hear the sound of cursing me in my head
All of my friends are gathered, each day makes me happy yeah
It seems to go higher
You could love me more yeah
I can't hide
All happiness tightens me yeah yeah yeah
Even if I hear the sound of cursing me, I'm in happiness right now yeah",0

SECOND GEN PAVED THE WAY FOR KPOP AND YOU ALL SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE IT. During their time, we weren't big on the use of the internet not all fans could vote for them, and yet they were known all over the world. I am a part of different fandoms now but no one should say BTS, or any other KPOP group now, are the reason that KPOP is booming. Never forget the efforts of the 1st and 2nd gen idols and artists. I'm saying this not to hate or discredit any group but rather to inform everyone that some (and I repeat some) armys are so in over their heads that they forget and discredit other idols and idols groups (no matter what generation) of things that they deserve. I hope the non-toxic armys (true fans in my opinion really) will find a way to make the others learn, please don't just defend the fandom, rather correct the ones who are doing wrong. Other fandoms are already doing this every time they see wrong opinions of people from the same fandom.

1. Bigbang is one of the first group to start writing and producing their own music. G-Dragon is the first idol to do it. And not only writing songs but he produced such a hit song(Lies-Bigbang). After that agencies started giving their idols chance to do it.

2.  Bigbang is the first one to have official lightstick.The first official lightstick in kpop was designed by G-Dragon. It was called Bang Bong. Since then all fandoms followed it and now every fandom has their own lightstick.

3. T.O.P is the first underground rapper turned idol in kpop and the first rapper in kpop to have a deep voice. After that it became a trend for every group to have a rapper with a deep voice.

4. Bigbang is the first boy group to dye their hair bright unusual colors like pink, blue, neon green, orange. G-Dragon made it trend, starting from blonde there is no color he hasn't tried. Now every kpop idol will color their hair differently in every comeback.

5. Bigbang is the first group that members have solo careers without disbanding. Before bigbang, groups always disbanded or the member just left if one of them wants to pursuit their own career. But Bigbang showed them you can have solo career while still being in the group. Taeyang and Gdragon have won daesangs(main awards) for their solo career and always topped the charts including Billboard. Daesung was so popular in Japan (more popular than bigbang itself lol)

6. And to this day G-Dragon is still the only soloist from idol groups to win Artist of the Year/Daesang.

7. In 2014, G-dragon won World's Best Entertainer Of The Year and World's Best Album at World Music Awards,
and the first kpop act to have two albums on the Billboard 200.

8. Seungri once had his own vocal and dance academy that have trained many idols such as J-Hope from BTS, Mijoo from Lovelyz, Jinwoo from Winner, Zelo from B.A.P , Hyung Won from Monsta X, Hye Lin from EXID and many other artists.

9. First kpop artist to collaborate with western artist. G-Dragon's collaboration with Flo Rida back in 2009.

10. First kpop group to win an international award. In 2011, they won MTV EMA. They beat Britney Spears that day. They also won World's Best Group, World's Best Live Act and World's Best Video Of The Year (Fantastic Baby) in 2014 World Music Awards.

11. They were able to enter U.S Billboard Charts 200 (2012) with a full korean album making them the first Kpop group to achieve that without any promotion in U.S

12. They introduced the concept of EP(Mini Album) to kpop.

13. They set the fashion trends because they were the inspiration for many fashion designers.

14. G-Dragon is the one who made kpop idol airport fashion trend. He also become the first asian
to be a global brand ambassador of fashion brand (Chanel)

15. They are also called the kings of live performances coz their stage presences were insane. When you impressed by watching their MVs, trust me their live performances are better !!! 

16. And until now Bigbang still trending everyday in Melon (Biggest music streaming platform in korea) without doing anything and not releasing any music. Their last song before hiatus titled ""Flower Road"" broke many records and topped all the charts in korea without a single promotion and they were already in the military when the song was released.

17. Today they are still the best selling kpop group in China's history despite being 4 years of hiatus. 

18. And until today they still held the record for the biggest kpop concert tour ever (Bigbang - Made World Tour)

19. They are your idols' idols, many idols wanted to be idols because of them. Big Bang may not be your bias, but they're your bias' bias

20. They have conquered two generations since their debut in 2006(2nd gen) and when they comeback in this 4th gen, imagine the impact.

Their influence and impact in kpop is heavy.They are the blueprints of kpop that is why they are called the KINGS.",0

1611,1611,Amirah Zafirah,ALL OF BIGBANG SONGS ARE TIMELESS I CAN LISTEN TO IT THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE LIFETIME.,0
1612,1612,Mubashirah Zaidi,"i think ppl tend to forget how hard it was for bigbang back when they debuted. they were looked at as though they debuted with golden spoons in their mouth but it was very from it. when they debuted, everyone called them ugly and told them that they’d never make it big and that they should quit. they were ridiculed for everything they did. it wasn’t until Lies came out that ppl finally realized the talent they had. 
then in 2009 with g-dragons solo artist debut he was attacked for plagiarizing Flo Rida which sent him endless hate. it got so bad that they had to reach out to flo rida himself to clear up the issue, flo rida and his team said that there was no trace of plagiarism and respected gd. 
this is not even close to the worst scandal they’ve had. people always think BIGBANG had it easy. but they didn’t. at first they didn’t even have enough money to eat, and ended up starving since their manager sometimes failed to bring them food at their dorm. they would have no money so would share a pack of cookies amongst each other, letting it melt in their mouth to savour the taste and make the cookie last longer.
in 2011, daesung got into a car accident that people believed killed someone, although someone had died, it wasn’t daesungs fault and police reports proved it. but people still didn’t believe him, they called him a murderer and told him to leave BIGBANG. he didn’t leave his room for months, and couldn’t face his own parents bc he was embarrassed. even tho he didn’t kill the person, he still apologized for it, apologized to the family, and even paid for the funeral. 
then G-dragon got involved in a marijuana scandal, where people called him a druggie and pothead. he didn’t even intentionally smoke the weed, he was offered a cigarette at a party, and not knowing the smell of weed, he took a puff but realized that it tasted weird so he quickly stopped. police reports even showed that the trace of marijuana was very little, supporting his claim. but still, people attacked him. 
in 2012, they came back from all these scandals with a song called Monster, displaying their emotions saying “i’m not a monster, you know me” “let’s stay together till the end” as most vips turned their backs on them and starting hating. 
they also released Fantastic Baby in 2012, garnering worldwide attention, setting them on top once again. BIGBANG has proved themselves to went thru the worst, but people still didn’t think it was enough. 
we all know abt 2015 MADE and T.O.P scandal so we don’t need to go into that as T.O. P is continuously apologizing to his fans even 3 years later for his actions and how he embarrassed everyone, especially his fans and mother and bandmates.
2018, people accused GD of having special care in his military enlistment. they didn’t even leave him alone even when he was serving his country. haters came at him, telling him to stop acting like he’s injured. 
2019, people accused Seungri of disgusting allegations that he denied, pleading people to put his trust in him, but no. the nation turned their back, tainted his career forever, forced him to leave BIGBANG and retire from the Kpop Industry. 
1 year later? 2020, he’s proven innocent. but people won’t apologize. kbs won’t apologize for ruining an innocent mans life. now the only cases he’s facing is a financial case regarding his business. these cases have nothing to do with women and drugs and mostly result in a fine, no jail time. but still, people continuously hate on him, hate on BIGBANG, claiming it’s their end. there are so so so many more hardships they’ve faced, im not saying all this to get ur pity, it’s for ppl to realize how much BIGBANG went thru, yet still came back on top. 
3 years later, after getting so much, so many petitions for the group to disband, they are coming back. coachella 2020 is going to be a blast. even tho they faced so much hate in their country, BIGBANG decided to come back. why? bc they care abt their fans. they want to finish what they started. they’ve said it before, “when we disband and stop making music, let’s do it with pride and no regret”. and they, are proving their words. these 5 men are perfect examples of true artists. not letting anything stop them from doing what they love, music. their popularity was based off pure talent, their voices, their charisma, their drive, not looks. they’ve said it endlessly they will never forget the reason they started music, to not let their wealth and fame and get in the way of their mindset they had when the first debuted. i could go on forever abt this beautiful band. they truly are the kings of kpop.",0

1749,1749,e h,"This song is genius for so many different reasons. Consider both the instrumentation and the lyrics. The instrumentation is quite joyous and happy. The song itself is in F major, an key that evokes the emotion of calm happiness and joy. We're all here just enjoying the moment is what the instrumentation tells you. However, when you read the lyrics, they are a bit off. You realize this person is just covering their pain. We can hear through the lyrics, a song of someone who is lonely and struggling. I get from the lyrics two things:
1) not being able to survive without some kind of substance (alcohol, drugs, whatever)
2) not being able to survive without the audience

The second interpretation is quite sad. I imagine every artist at the level of Big Band must experience something similar to this. The high that you get from that level of human interaction......it's something very few people in the entire history of the world will experience. But then after the lights and the music and the cheers fade, what are these musicians left with? I imagine the life bands such as Big Bang lead are very difficult. 

And then we have the MV which has so many meanings if you stop and think about the images. We have the different beds in a field (a field which has a sign that reads 'Dreams'). Maybe they represent the ever changing hotels/houses they have to live in to follow their dreams? Then there's the smoke that's constantly covering the field. They're always covered in this smoke throughout the video. Then there's the colorful four walls (always changing angles) that the five members are trapped in. Then there's the the call for the taxi to take them away from the chaos, only for them to enter the taxi which in itself is chaotic. Just, the whole song (instrumentation, lyrics, MV) work on so many levels and have multiple interpretations. Genius. This is the reason it's one of, if not my favorite, Big Bang song. 

Thank you, BB. Thank you for your music and your sacrifice. I hope you can find happiness and peace even after the lights fade and the cheers stop. This world is full of beauty, and you deserve to experience that beauty in both the intensity of the stage as well as the quiet of the mundane. Best wishes!",0

Can you believe it..... i now look back and relaise how.much I loved these songs. I secretly wished they would play a certain song. 2017 was when I relalised I was dragged into kpop. Took me a good 4-5 years to realise.

Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8, yeah
Countin' them bands all way to the top, 'til they be fallin' over
Countin' them bands on my way to the top, 'til we fallin' over

I don't really care if you cry
On the real you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to, die""
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Phantom that's all red
Inside all white
Like something you ride a sled down
I just want that head
My Brittany got mad
I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stacking my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like ""Come on over""
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me
I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it, I swear that it's slowing me, yeah

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""I am not afraid to, die""
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah


That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em
Medicine, little nigga take some
Fast car, Nascar, race 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas
Got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G, though
Looking at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was counting that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

She say, ""You're the worst, you're the worst""
I cannot die, because this my universe

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to, die""
Push me to the edge

Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8… (Yeah)
Countin' them bands
All way to the top 'til they be fallin' over
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Countin' them bands
On my way to the top 'til we fallin' over

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to die""
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Verse 1]
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, ""Come on over!""
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (Hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah
[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""I am not afraid to die"" (Yeah)
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge (Yeah)
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (Yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say, ""You're the worst, you're the worst""
I cannot die because this my universe
[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to die""

For years I wanted to be a musician but fear always made me say ""My time is too late, I missed my shot"" At 26 I became fed up with the day to day, moved to rural japan ???? and started putting out music. My grandfather passed away on Christmas Eve, which is why i've been really relentless. I know that it's the TIME to get moving ?!! So I made a CHILL Hiphop/Jazz song called ??""Tsunami"" ?? that sampled a dope Japanese city pop artist Kikuchi Momoku's song. It feels extra special to create these songs, since I live in Japan!

I found out how to get a Dragon Ball Z Adult Gohan or Dragon Ball GT (Manga) Vegeta Haircut
""I want a _""
Low Taper
5 on the sides
No side burns
Scissor Trim at the top
Edge up with the Hair pushed back instead of brushed forward
(Mean Girls Fashion
""Your hair looks sexy pushed back"")
I don't use gel b/c gel thins out the hair follicles & activates the balding process or speeds up balding
Two week maintenance
Not every barber or hair stylist can bring this haircut to fruition
Most people can't tell the difference between a fade and a taper
I hate fades
Like they shave all sides of your head & leave a patch of hair on the top
Taper usually gives you a fuller head of hair
Sometimes i have to say
""Extremely Low Taper""
Or repeat ""Taper""
Their clients usually get fades & never had to learn how to
I can tell right away when the barber messed up my request
If you cut up pass the side burn area & touch the rest of the sides
They're going higher than a low taper.

3060,3060,Fritmeow,"This song isn’t just a normal sad song it’s dedicated to sulli hara and jonghyun 
8 represents infinity ( forever young ) 
IU and sulli’s friendship : 8
Jonghyun birthday  : 8 April 
they all suicided due to the hate they got 
In the mv of eight 

The video starts with IU going into a Lab sort of place and clicking a button and it shows a computer with a orange screen on the screen it says 
      “Do u want to see your memories”
              Yes                   No 
She presses yes and the rest of the mv is her memories with sulli , jonghyun and hara 
the lizard / chameleon represents hara 
The dragon represents jonghyun 
And the girl on the dragon represents sulli
In the mv IU  had a dream that she was in a plane and the chameleon was with her then suddenly lightning strikes and the chameleon disappears  she woke up and went to see the cage in which the lizard / chameleon was and it was missing 
Then there was a part in which she sees the dragon and the girl ( sulli and jonghyun ) fly away from her while she was watching them from the plane

The line “Goodbye is like a emergency alert” is because there was a kind of alarm that tell them to buckle there seat belts because of the storm or whatever u want to call the weather and right then the chameleon disappears 
The chameleon disappears which meant the “goodbye” and she gets a emergency alert to buckle her seatbelt’s and to keep the electronic devices off - “like a emergency alert” 

The line “so are you happy now”
Has two meanings 
1. For sulli bcs she said she has never been happy
2. To the haters 

Fun fact : IU’s makeup for this song was done by sulli’s makeup artist 

Haters please think twice before hating on someone you never know how much it affects them 
And also if u hate them don’t say anything just mind your own business

*Please note that this is my theory and I do not know if it is the real meaning behind the song*",0

3122,3122,gghoop01@gmail.com,"IU. Although I haven’t been with you as long as I could have, I don’t need to talk about how much you’ve changed my life. My introduction to you came from one song I happened to hear years ago, and only returned to every now and again. However, over the past few years, I took the time to actually pursue you and learn more about you. I still haven’t learned as much as I could have, but you’ve already opened my eyes to music so much. I know that a term that is used to describe your presence in music is “The Girl Next Door.” For a bit of time, I couldn’t quite understand this, and then I realized that the meaning of this isn’t in the literal term, but the feelings that are implied from it. I couldn’t quite understand why when I listened to your voice, I felt this closeness to you that I couldn’t define. Then I realized, it is because your voice represents all of the comforts and joys of one’s life. You encompass so much familiarity and nostalgia in a single note that you sing, and I’ve never heard anybody sing like this before. It is a combination of your voice that is as delicate as a lullaby, and the sincerity of the words that you sing. Anybody who hears your voice first the first time might be so overwhelmed by its individuality that they might not even be able to explain what’s happening to them at first. They could just be experiencing your voice for the first time, and it can instantly take them back to some of the happiest moments of their life. Only you can evoke these strong emotions in other people when you sing. When I hear your voice, I don’t know whether I should submit to the feelings I’ve been afraid to confront, or parade around with confidence and optimism. I don’t know how you can capture so much in just your voice, but what you have is honestly a quality that only you were born with. One cannot work to gain what you possess, but rather, only you can share with the world the gift that you have. In a flash, somebody can feel of all the warm and distant feelings as well as recall their fondest memories because you ignite that in an individual. I’ve never known somebody to hold such a power and an effect on others, and I often wonder if we deserve such a genuine voice like yours. You are also an incredibly talented dancer, always moving so swiftly and with so much energy. It’s been a joy watching you on several different stages, sharing the messages you’ve always wanted to through your movements and gestures. You really know how to communicate through your expression of dance and personal style. I cannot even sum up how revolutionary of a performer you are. What you have cannot be defined by the limitations of words, but it can only be felt by your audience, fans, and other musicians. You’re almost unreal, because the impact that you have on us is just magical. We get taken to a place in our minds that is only unlocked when we get to witness and be a part of your artistic vision. Your mind is just brilliant, and even the way you decide to create your music videos is so detailed and thought-out. You simply know how to use music to make people aware of what this world has to offer, and I believe that nobody understands the potential of music like you do. You have a relationship with it like no other, and we are blessed that you decided to explore this connection.0 I cannot wait to see where your music takes you next, because there is absolutely no telling how you’ll make us feel. You are one of the purest people I know. You just absorb the emotions of others and represent them through your music and attitude. You are always putting others before you and your demeanor is just admirable. You are one of the humblest and poised people I know, and this is another of many reasons why you just feel comforting and familiar. Just getting to be here with you is completely bliss, as you are just kind-hearted and gentle. I want to thank your parents and family for raising you and bringing you to us in this manner. I can’t even imagine how they must feel to know that their loved ones has risen to become one of the most influential and legendary people to interact with music. I have no doubt in my mind that you cherish them like no other, given how sweet you are to somebody who you come in contact with for just a second. I know you have the utmost respect for them and keep them with you every step of your journey. If ever you feel lost, deserted, alone, or confused, I hope you can always look to them. I hope you know you can always rely on them and turn to them for comfort. They are always going to remind you of who you are and to help get you back on your feet. Never think that you are disappointing them, because they know that you honor them with every action you take. Whether you fall down or you triumph, they will be proud of you no matter what. They will always be the most supportive of you and will love you more than anybody else. Your fans keep them in our hearts as you do, and we will always strive to be as half as considerate and selfless as they are. On the topic of your fans, thank you for your fierce loyalty and dedication to them over the years. I am a fairly new fan, but I can see the people that they have turned out to be because of the affection you’ve showered them with since before you even debuted. It’s been nothing but the greatest years of their lives, and I can imagine that it is the greatest honor in the world getting to be by your side. There is no greater feeling than what you give tho them, and as a new fan, I can say that there is much truth in this statement. Their happiest days and memories have been filled with you, and there is no replacement for that spot that you will always fill in their hearts. You are unforgettable and they are going to look back on the times they spent with you to return the peak of their happiness. You’ve changed their lives in ways that can only be seen in the way they carry themselves. I know you’ve been through a lot, and this cannot be overstated enough. What we’ve seen has already been too much, and nobody should ever go through the pain of losing anybody that they love. We don’t even know all that you’ve had to endure to make it where you are now, and much of it might always remain a mystery. I know that anybody can agree it takes a strength that people don’t have innately to brave your way through these difficulties. One of your greatest strengths is that you channel these struggles and moments of pain into your music. It is one of the healthiest and most impactful ways to cope and emote. It is only then that people are able to empathize with you on a spiritual and soulful level. You honor those you’ve lost and document the everyday occurrences that most undergo through your music. You are telling the stories of all of our lives and you do in such a natural way. On behalf of all of your loved ones, we are beyond proud of you for using these unbearable moments in your life as reason for motivation. The life and legacy of so many live on through your voice. I hope that all of your dreams come true on this special day, and that you get to accomplish all that you set your mind to. Provided that you are one of the most generous people that I know, it might be hard to look at yourself in such a high manner, but I hope you let your fans celebrate and commemorate you. If you ever want to know how you’ve touched us, look at us for a reflection of your character. We are what you give to us, and countless of people are living honestly and hopefully because of you. I hope that those around you also help you to feel as special and inspirational as you truly are to countless people. Please relax on your day, and you can take from it some unforgettable memories.  I hope it turns out to be one of the greatest days you’ve ever had. Thank you for sacrificing so much to make so much possible, both musically and in other areas of the world. Thank you for suffering through any pain, fear, isolation, frustration, fatigue, concern, doubt, hardships, and so much more just to bring us the smallest bit of content. You deserve all of the success, glory, and blessings that come to you. I hope you never feel obligated to change because the world needs you just as you are. You are sincerely an angel sent from heaven to help piece together this fragmented world. You are the glue holding us together, and the light that is left in this world. You are beyond beautiful inside and out, and I hope you never change. Please don’t overwork yourself. I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future.

It is very true that even a handful of memories can haunt you forever, how somebody's presence in your life, no matter how brief, becomes as island you find yourself coming back to over and over again. I am so thankful Yoongi led me to delve into IU's discography.

3134,3134,Lauren Smith,"Dont you see? This song was originally meant for her three close friends who have all passed away from suicide. In the beginning, there is a screen that says 'do you wish to visit your memories?' and she (or someone) clicks 'yes'. turn captions to English if you haven't already! in the beginning, it says 'so are you happy now' it is for Sulli, one of her close three friends who commit suicide, for Sulli has never been able to feel happiness. it is also a rhetorical question towards the haters who got under Sulli's skin, like asking 'so are you happy, happy now that your goal is accomplished?' the lizard represents Goo HaRa (i'm pretty sure), and the dragon represents Jeonghyeon. when IU is animated and in the plane, it shows Go HaRa in the form of a lizard. however, the plane suddenly has extreme turbulence - an indication that something bad is/was gonna happen, which is, the suicide of Go HaRa. 

it is beautiful and sad, but ultimately, proves that IU is a caring person who is also strong. strong for her deceased friends and for herself.",0

The storm in airplane it's showing that IU hold pain on her chest as the lyrics said ""I think i've lost everything"". But then, she knows that she must walk forward, that's why the storm gones and IU in the airplane smiles at the girl with flying dragon, that's mean she already let them (Jonghyun & Sulli) free, IU not regret what she choose and she choose to remember them by memories just like what the lyrics said, ""i travel through worn-out memories"".

This song and the mv is so cool. She told us to let someone who not with us anymore, let them go so they can be happy. Although they not say goodbye, you must let them go.
""There's no depressing ending"" means Jonghyun and Sulli finally can live happy without pain anymore.",0

I pray for IU safety and Suga's recovery.KING OF RAP AND QUEEN OF VOCAL, we will forever be grateful for giving us this beautiful and healing song. The fact that IU and SUGA,make this song even more special because they both have also gone through alot poverty, difficult early life, tough journey to become an artists they both are now and specially depression. Every Armys and Uaenas know they both have been through depression, we have been very worried  for both after Jonghyun, Sulli and Hara left us. After Jonghyun's death, Suga said he really sympathize Jonghyun because he could relate to it. Suga also had many suicidal thoughts in the past. Those words completely broke Armys heart. Let's protect every artists from now on and give them lots of love. If you don't like any artist, fine don't watch them but never say anything negative or hate them. Let's never let hatred and those evil win. 

Dear, Jonghyun Si, Sulli Si and Hara Si. We hope you all are happy now and at peace .We believe you all are together in a better place filled lots of love ,happiness, freedom, arts, music and peace. We all will miss you all forever. We are really sorry that you all have to gone through alot because of some evil people among us .Rest in Peace, Beautiful Souls.??????",0

3550,3550,Patsy Reynolds,"A lot of non-Blackjacks who seem to have discovered 2NE1, for new listeners 2NE1 was called Ugly when they first debuted. They were constantly bullied by both YG and others. They were outcasts of their time and didn't fit the girl group style, just look at other groups out at their time. SNSD (Girl's Generation), Kara, T-ara, Wonder Girls, and 4Minute. Most girl groups where very ""pretty"" in their styling. This group of girls where the odd balls out. But I will say I think that's why I really liked them. And to all the BlackPink fans coming to 2NE1 and thinking they have a similar vibe and sound it's because they have the exact same producer that 2NE1 had (Teddy Park [produced I believe all their songs]) and some of the songs originally meant for 2NE1 went to BlackPink. I am a hardcore BJ and I love my girls. Still sad over their disbanding, I honestly think they outrank BlackPink.",0
3551,3551,Z,"I used to cry to this song because of what I found out. I was in college, my younger sister was in high school. One day I was randomly looking for a cleaned paper I could use in the cabinet, then I saw a little notebook. It was my sister's diary. She basically wrote there that she wanted to pursue Hotel and Restaurant Management (HRM) in college just like my older sister but she thinks she's not qualified because she's fat and ugly. She's a very kind girl and it literally shattered my heart reading that, and the fact that at her young age she could already think like that made me feel so bad. She has now graduated college but she took up Pharmacy which she likes, and as for me I'm currently in med school.

This song is so empowering and it's one of the reasons why I will forever be a blackjack. They don't make songs like this anymore tackling mental health.",0

But after getting to know 2ne1 and living in Korea I totally can understand them... actually according to American standards I think 2ne1 is so beautiful because each member expresses so much individuality and confidence. These two things are the most important factors in American beauty standards. But Korean beauty standards are all about fitting into a typical look. I really love Korea but I hate that they try to fit people into a specific mold... I now understand why they made this song and I can relate to it 100%.

Only a true fans of 2NE1 can see their deep beauty... the individuality of their voices... the aura... the clothes that they look great...the character on stage when they sing... but together they can pull out their emotions to their music that a fans can feel them ( even most of us cannot understand korean song including me??).

As a long-time Blackjack & glasses wearer, I very much appreciate the fact that these girls still talk about feeling ugly when they're all done up and not trivializing ugliness with clothes or makeup or glasses.

When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run, run, run, run, run
Staring at the lights, they look so pretty
Momma said ""Son, son, son, son, son
You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old
All that glitters don't turn to gold
But until then just have your fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run""

[Refrain]
Yeah, run, run, run
Run, run, run

[Verse 2]
When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last three, four, five days
Living it up but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run

[Chorus]
They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day, well, the sky might fall
Yеah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learnеd one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run

[Refrain]
Run, run, run

[Verse 3]
Didn't get everything that I wanted
But I got what I need, yeah yeah
I see that light in the morning
Shining down on me
So take me up high, take me down low
Where it all ends nobody knows
But until then let's have some fun
Yeah, run, run, run, run, run

[Chorus]
They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yeah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run

[Refrain]
Run, run, run
Yeah, run, run, run

[Outro]
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings

When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run, run, run, run, run
Staring at the lights, they look so pretty
Momma said ""son son son son son
You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old
All that glitters don't turn to gold
But until then just have your fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run""
Yeah, run, run, run
Run, run, run
When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last three, four, five days
Living it up but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run
They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yеah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learnеd one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Run, run, run
Didn't get everything that I wanted
But I got what I need, yeah yeah
I see that light in the morning
Shining down on me
So take me up high, take me down low
Where it all ends nobody knows
But until then let's have some fun
Yeah, run, run, run, run, run
They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yeah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Run, run, run
Yeah, run, run, run
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun, yeah, run, run, run",0

Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help 
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me?

We don't talk much, not anymore 
Broken bottles and skammin' doors 
But we still care about each other
Say we care about each other 
I know life took us far away 
But I still dream 'bout the good old days 
When we took care of each other 
We were livin' for each other 

But I start to wonder, wonder 
If I'm slippin' under, under (oh, oh)

Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help 
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me?

Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help 
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me?

Yeah, I miss all the times we had
Can't forget what you can't get back 
And you can't find it in another 
Man, time, it ain't your lover 
I don't care what you thought before 
I'll be there any time you call 
Don't you ever call another 
No need to call another 

And I start to wonder, wonder 
If I'm slippin' under, under (oh,oh)

Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?) 
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help 
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me? (Yeah) 

Would you rescue me?
Oh, rescue me (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me?
Oh, rescue me

Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help 
Would you rescue me? (Uh)
Would you rescue me?


Thanks for reading and liking my comment. 
During these last days, I've started writing some popular song lyrics and posting them as comments on YouTube. 
I'm also planning to write and perform new songs of mine and post some videos of them on my YouTube channel. 
I invite you all to visit my official YouTube channel and it means me a lot if you'd subscribe and listen to my next musical interpretations, too.

Our younger version is one faced and the true one without any masks (majority of the times).....which is why the older self is pleading the younger self  to rescue  him (by not killing his real self and rather kill the bad thoughts )

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love? If I need your help?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

[Verse 1]
We don't talk much, not anymore
Broken bottles and slammin' doors
But we still care about each other
Say we care about each other
I know life took us far away
But I still dream 'bout the good old days
When we took care of each other
We were livin' for each other

[Pre-Chorus]
But I start to wonder, wonder
If I'm slipping under, under (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah
Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I miss all the times we had
Can't forget what you can't get back
And you can't find it in another
Man, time, it ain't your lover
I don't care what you thought before
I'll be there anytime you call
Don't you ever call another
No need to call another

[Pre-Chorus]
And I start to wonder, wonder
If I'm slipping under, under (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah
Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me? (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Would you rescue me?
Oh, rescue me (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me? (When I'm by myself?)
(When I need your love, if I need your help)
Oh, rescue me
(Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?)

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?

Would you rescue me when I’m by myself
When I need your love
If I need your help
Would you rescue me
Would you rescue me

We don’t talk much not anymore
Broken bottles and slamming doors 
But we still care about each other
Say we care about each other

I know life took us far away
But I still dream about the good old days
When we took care of each other
We were living for each other

But I start to wonder, wonder
If I’m slipping under, under

Can’t forget what you can’t get back
And you can’t find it in another

I don’t care what you thought before
I’ll be there any time you call
Don’t you ever call another
No need to call another

4975,4975,Riva ocean view,"Creep alert  - some person sent some creepy guy looking my direction out of the retail store I just went into.....He was walking out and was looking directly at me eeeewww not for me........ I'm taken....by you.....a creep is some man to which I'm definitely not attracted to at all....
Why do they look..?
Cause they're either single or whatever. 
I'm tired of men I'm not attracted to thinking they can win my heart and they can't do I'm hoping some other person is fixing all the black men and all the white men.... And all the others..
I guess they can look and dream....
Not my fault. 
They should always give some person the person they want right away just to date them every week so they can decide right away if they want that person otherwise they both might be subjected to a bunch of people they don't even want to know.
I'm just wanting some nice man to love me....
When a person lives another person enough to take them everywhere with them and make them a party of their family then they love them enough to live them.....
A person can't live a person unless they find someone to love them because life is incredibly boring and lonely too the point they really have nobody at all to help them in life because NOBODY can depend on that invisible person to live them because they aren't there 24 hours a day including the emergency contact while they are at work... That's what a spouse is supposed to be always... Nobody should have to use anyone else for an emergency contact unless they're past 65 years of age or born disabled....
People don't naturally disable themselves so that they don't have to work..... Some other mean people did this to me to get revenge.... Because all they were wanting to do was just live people and never have a home to go home to after they did their job to reach out and help some others stay in life..
I thought NSA was actual security for investigation of foreign terrorists or people that did crimes in the nation.. Didn't know they were investigating domestic crimes and why didn't they put the crimes against me into the court so I could have a case that was done..?
I should be in the class teaching them because they could learn a lot from me. 
It's not fair to leave some person any person homeless just because they don't want to close a case..",0

4999,4999,Chitts Jr,"My teenage years are going to end soon and I'm so so so so scared. I'm so so scared. I'm not scared of too many things but growing old takes the cake. It gets me so fucking sad to the point I cry. It's kinda stupid to feel all that fit something you have no control over and that everyone goes through it. But nothing seems to make it better for me. I get depressed when I see old pictures, any random then\now pictures from the internet, old forgotten songs, birthdays, even when I'm randomly watching an anime and the 3rd years are about to leave their group of friends after graduating. I don't like hearing about old age, I don't want to talk about it, I don't wanna read about it, I don't want to see about it. All these and so much more. It just makes me so sad and nostalgic and sorry that I'm growing old. Idk how to stop feeling like this. The future is so scary ..

Also I'm weeping because I completely forgot this song and band existed and it came up in my recommendation and the wave of forgotten nostalgia hit me like a brick. Tearing up even harder as I sing along my mouth seems to remember all the lyrics even after all these years. .... Sorry this seemed a bit dramatic but
